#### Using and interacting with external libraries

* General-purpose libraries like jQuery, lodash, Bootstrap, Material Design
* IF frameworks like Twine, Ink, Quixe, and Vorple
    * Necessary to run basically any interactive story
    * Most can be extended simply by the user
* Used to change what libraries are doing and how
    * Direct state access
    * Programmatic page changes (Twine/Ink)
    * Addition of rich content (media, menus, popouts, event handlers, etc.) to parser IF
