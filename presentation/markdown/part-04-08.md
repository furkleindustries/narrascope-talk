#### Be focused

* Define your scope and stick with it until you can make something
    * Areas of interest
    * Specific artworks
    * Toolsets
* Stay on track when researching
* Make things constantly
    * Practice beats theory in code (and art)
    * ~~"I'll do that when I'm a real programmer"~~
    * You don't need programming fundamentals to copy examples and exercises
