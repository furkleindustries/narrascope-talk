#### It's so easy to get started with JavaScript

* All you have to do is open a (desktop) browser
* Open the developer tools
    * (Ctrl|âŒ˜)-Shift-I, or
    * Right click -> Inspect element
* Select "Console"
* ```javascript
  console.log('hello, world!');
  ```
* Inspect, reference, and make live changes to any website on the Internet!
* This line says "Hi, I'm Claire Furkle!" Or does it?
