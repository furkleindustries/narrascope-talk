#### Be smart about failure

* Embrace failure
* Failure is a tool for learning, not a sign of incompetence
* Failure produces meaningful, unteachable lessons about what works for you
* Compiler/interpreter errors may look scary, but they're actually great
  * Tells you what the error is
  * Where it arose, and how
  * Provides searchable details and names
