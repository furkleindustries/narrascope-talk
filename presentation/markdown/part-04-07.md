#### Be smart about failure

* Embrace failure
* Failure is a tool for learning, not a sign of weakness
* Failure produces meaningful lessons about what works for you in ways that cannot be taught
* Compiler/interpreter errors may look scary, but they're actually part of what makes programming great
